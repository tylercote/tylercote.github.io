                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HQ Trivia is an app that was released in 2017 that allows users to win money by correctly answering trivia questions.
                        The host asks a series of 10 questions (each with 4 options), and if a user gets one wrong they are disqualified.  All of those
                        remaining at the end of the 10 questions (having answered each one correctly) is paid out an equal proportion of the prize money.
                            Below is an example of a question that could be asked during a game of HQ Trivia:
                        </p>

                        <img style="width: 300px" class="project-img" src="assets/HQExample.jpg"/>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan and I realized that by simply searching the question in Google, we can usually pretty quickly find out
                            what the correct answer is.  Therefore, we decided to build this program to automate this process.  The program constantly monitors
                            a folder that is specified by the user for new screenshots.  When a screenshot is taken, the program used the Tesseract library to
                            perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert the question as well as all 4 of the answers into strings that can be used
                            by the program.  Then, the question is fed into the Google CustomSearch API, and the program parses the result "snippets" (think
                            the blurb description under each search result when you perform a Google search) for occurrences of each of the answers.  It will then
                            display these scores for the user to see, and for the user to ultimately decide which answer to pick and tap it on the device.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever though it would be interesting to see how "musically compatible" you are with a friend?
                            Now you can. Well, kind of. At Hack Beanpot 2018, some friends and I decided it would be cool to put together
                            a website that does just this.  We spent a lot of our development time trying to overcome some issues we had with the Spotify API,
                            and we encountered rate-limiting restrictions that disallowed us from conducting the analysis that we had originally wished to do.  As a result, the final project still contained some hard-coded data. Despite these shortcomings,
                            we had a great time hacking this project together, and learned a lot about working with Angular, OAuth and web APIs in the process.  We also learned that coding for 48 hours straight surrounded by others doing the same WILL make you sick 🤒.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game Defense of the Ancients (DotA) 2 features two teams, Radiant and Dire, consisting of
                            5 heroes each, who fight to destroy the enemy team's base.  In the competitive mode of this game,
                            there is a picking phase where each team alternates in both picking their own heroes, and selecting
                            heroes to ban (meaning both teams are unable to pick this hero).  Due to the differing abilities of each hero,
                            picking certain heroes to "counter" heroes on the other team can provide a competitive advantage.
                        </p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site <a href="https://www.dotabuff.com/" style="color: #5fdbe6">dotabuff.com</a> provides
                            statistics about all things DotA 2, including statistics about how well heroes counter other heroes.
                            For example, the hero Anti-Mage has a + 5.52% advantage when playing against Zeus.  This is because Zeus deals mainly magic damage,
                            and Anti-Mage's skills and abilities provide him with extra protection against magic damage:

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tool allows a player to enter in all of the heroes that have been picked and banned in the game so far,
                            and using a web scraper, calculates aggregated statistics about what heroes to pick (and ban) in order to gain a
                            competitive advantage.
